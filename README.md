## Why

On Windows / Linux, right-click triggers the context menu when the button is **released** — so you can press → drag → preview → release. macOS triggers on press, which:

1. Forces you to commit before seeing the context.
2. Breaks mouse-gesture extensions (CrxMouse, Smartup, Gesturefy) because the menu appears before any drag is detected.

`gesture-ex` shifts the trigger to mouse-up at the HID layer and adds native mouse gestures that don't rely on any browser extension.

## Features

### Right-click on mouse-up
Hold the right mouse button as long as you want, drag to a different spot, release — context menu appears at the release position. Or release in place for normal behavior.

### 4-direction mouse gestures
Drag with right-button held in a supported browser, release to fire an action.

| Default | Action            | Shortcut |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| ←       | Back              | ⌘ [      |
| →       | Forward           | ⌘ ]      |
| ↑       | Scroll to Top     | Home     |
| ↓       | Scroll to Bottom  | End      |

13 actions are available out of the box: Back / Forward / Reload / Hard Reload / New Tab / Close Tab / Reopen Closed Tab / Next Tab / Previous Tab / New Window / Scroll to Top / Scroll to Bottom / Disabled.

### User-drawn custom gestures
Draw multi-segment patterns (`←↑`, `↓→`, `↑↓`, …) in the **Add Custom Gesture** modal and map each to any action. Recognized by direction-change detection (segment ≥ 30 px, dominant axis ratio ≥ 1.5).

### Live trail overlay
While dragging, a smooth blue trail follows the cursor with a floating label that **shows the action that will fire when you release**. The label updates in real time as the gesture direction changes.

### Per-engine toggles
Enable gestures independently for **Chromium** browsers and **WebKit** browsers — useful if you want gestures only in Chrome but not Safari, or vice versa.

### Adaptive fallback
- **Short click** (< 10 px) → context menu at release
- **Drag in non-browser app** → context menu at release
- **Drag with no recognizable direction** → silent cancel (no menu)
- **Drag matching a `Disabled` mapping** → context menu at release (intentional)
- **Drag matching a registered gesture** → action fires, menu suppressed

## Install

### Prerequisites
- macOS 11 +
- Swift toolchain (`xcode-select --install`)

### Build & run

```bash
# 1. (One-time) generate self-signed code signing cert.
#    Without this, TCC permissions reset on every rebuild.
./create-signing-cert.sh

# 2. Build
./build.sh

# 3. Launch
open gesture-ex.app
```

### Grant permissions

**System Settings → Privacy & Security**:

| Permission | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Accessibility | `+` → `gesture-ex.app` → toggle ON |
| Input Monitoring | same |

Then click the menu-bar icon, toggle **Enable right-click on mouse-up** OFF → ON. Status row should read `Status: ON ✓`.

## Usage

The menu-bar icon (`cursorarrow.click`) reveals:

```
Status: ON ✓
Active: Google Chrome — Chromium ✓
─────────
  Browser Gestures
✓   Chromium (Chrome / Edge / Brave / Arc / …)
✓   WebKit (Safari / Safari TP / Orion)
─────────
✓ Enable right-click on mouse-up    ⌥ ⌘ G
─────────
  Open Config…                      ⇧ ⌘ ,
─────────
  Launch at login
─────────
  Open Privacy Settings…
  About
  Quit                              ⌘ Q
```

Toggling **Chromium** or **WebKit** gestures ON automatically enables **Right-click on mouse-up** if it's currently OFF — gestures depend on it.

The `Active:` line tells you whether the currently-frontmost app is recognized as a Chromium or WebKit browser, and whether its gestures are enabled — invaluable when something doesn't fire as expected.

### Quick examples

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Right-click + 50 px **left** in Chrome | `← Back` overlay → page goes back |
| Right-click + 80 px **down** in Safari | `↓ Scroll to Bottom` overlay → page scrolls to end |
| Right-click + draw an **L** (`↓→`), if registered | `↓→ Close Tab` (or whatever you mapped) |
| Right-click + tiny shake | normal context menu at release position |
| Right-click + ambiguous diagonal (↗) | silent cancel, no menu |
| Right-click + drag in Slack (non-browser) | normal context menu |

## Customize

Open via `⇧⌘,` or menu → **Open Config…** — a sidebar window with four sections.

### Gesture Mappings
Pick an action for each cardinal direction (←/→/↑/↓).

### Live Overlay
- **Trail color** — system color picker
- **Background color** — color picker for the floating action label
- **Background opacity** — 0–100 % slider
- **Show action label** — toggle (the trail itself stays regardless)
- **Linger duration** — Instant (0.2 s) / Short (0.5 s) / Medium (1 s) / Long (1.5 s) / Very Long (2 s)

### Custom Gestures
1. Click **+ Add Custom Gesture…**
2. Click and drag inside the drawing area to capture a pattern
3. Pattern preview updates live (e.g. `←↑`)
4. Pick an action
5. **Save** — pattern is persisted in `UserDefaults` and recognized next time

### App Filter
Restrict the right-click-on-mouse-up conversion to specific apps.
- **Mode** — All apps (default) / Only listed / Exclude listed
- **Patterns** — one bundle ID per line (`com.google.Chrome`); prefix with `regex:` for regex (`regex:^com\.google\..*`); `#` lines are comments

                       kCGHIDEventTap  (lowest)
```

### Event flow

1. `EventTapController` registers a `CGEventTap` at `kCGHIDEventTap` — earlier than `kCGSessionEventTap`, important for Chromium's stricter input validation.
2. `rightMouseDown` is **swallowed** (callback returns `nil`). macOS's button-state machine never sees the press.
3. `GestureTrailWindow` polls `NSEvent.mouseLocation` at 60 Hz, drawing the trail and recording the path in CGEvent coordinates.
4. On `rightMouseUp`, `PathAnalyzer.analyze()` extracts a `GesturePattern` (array of `GestureDirection`) from the captured path.
5. Mapping lookup: custom multi-segment patterns first → fallback to single-direction `GestureMappings`.
6. `ActionExecutor` synthesizes a keyboard shortcut at HID level (`Cmd+[`, `Cmd+R`, …). The browser receives it as if the user pressed those keys.

Because everything happens at HID level and the browser only sees a synthetic keyboard shortcut, **no extension conflicts**. Disable any pre-existing CrxMouse / Smartup / Gesturefy.

## Tested browsers

**Chromium engine**: Chrome (stable / beta / canary / dev), Edge (all channels), Brave, Arc, Dia, Whale, Vivaldi, Opera, Opera GX, Yandex, CocCoc, open-source Chromium

**WebKit engine**: Safari, Safari Technology Preview, Orion (Kagi)

Adding a new browser = adding its bundle ID to `BrowserDetector.chromiumBundles` or `webkitBundles` and rebuilding.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Accessibility | Receive mouse events from HID layer |
| Input Monitoring | Required for HID event taps on macOS 10.15+ |

Both are scoped to the binary path, persisted by the self-signed code-signing identity (`RightClickOnUpDev`) created by `create-signing-cert.sh`. No data leaves the machine; no network calls.

```

### Iterate

```bash
# After editing any source file:
pkill -f gesture-ex
./build.sh
open gesture-ex.app
```

Stable code-signing identity means the rebuilt binary has the same code-signing authority — TCC keeps the previously granted permissions. **No re-authorization on rebuild.**

### Notable design decisions

- **Modular `Sources/` tree** — split by responsibility (App / Core / Domain / Storage / UI) so each layer has a single reason to change. `build.sh` compiles the whole tree as one Swift module, no SwiftPM overhead.
- **HID-level event tap** — session-level taps work for Finder but Chromium's renderer rejects synthesized events from session level. HID is necessary.
- **Self-signed certificate over ad-hoc** — ad-hoc signing changes `cdhash` every build, forcing TCC re-authorization. A stable cert keeps the same TCC identity across rebuilds without enrolling in Apple Developer Program.
- **`nonactivatingPanel` for overlays** — prevents the trail/label from stealing focus from the frontmost browser, which would otherwise route synthesized keystrokes back to `gesture-ex` itself.
- **60 Hz `NSEvent.mouseLocation` polling** — cheaper than another full event-tap subscription for `mouseMoved`, and sufficient for visual smoothness at any display refresh rate.
- **`includeIf` git config** — repository lives under `~/IdeaProjects/registas-hub/`, so a personal git identity activates automatically. Not visible in the repo, but documented here for contributors.

### Adding a new action

1. Add a `case` to `BrowserAction` (`Sources/Domain/BrowserAction.swift`)
2. Provide `keyCode`, `flags`, `label` for the new case
3. Rebuild — the new action automatically appears in:
   - 4-direction mapping `popup`s
   - Custom-gesture action picker

### Adding a new browser

Append the bundle ID to `BrowserDetector.chromiumBundles` or `webkitBundles` in `Sources/Core/BrowserDetector.swift`.

### Releasing

Releases are built and published by **GitHub Actions** on tag push (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).

**One-time setup** — register the signing cert as a repo secret so CI builds match local `cdhash`:

```bash
./create-signing-cert.sh         # if you don't have RightClickOnUpDev yet
./export-signing-cert.sh         # exports → base64 → registers SIGNING_CERT_P12_BASE64 + SIGNING_CERT_PASSWORD via gh CLI
rm -f RightClickOnUpDev.p12 RightClickOnUpDev.p12.base64   # cleanup local artifacts
```

If `gh` is not logged in, the script prints manual instructions for **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

**Cut a release**:

```bash
git tag -a v0.3.0 -m "Release v0.3.0"
git push origin v0.3.0
# → workflow runs on macos-14, signs with RightClickOnUpDev (or ad-hoc fallback if secrets missing),
#    zips with ditto, computes SHA256, and publishes the GitHub Release with auto-generated notes.
```

All releases go through the Actions workflow — there is no local-only release path.
